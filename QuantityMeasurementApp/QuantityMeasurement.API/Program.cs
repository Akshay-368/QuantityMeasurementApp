/// Now this one : app.UseHttpsRedirection();  is to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. ( like http://localhost:5228/ -> https://localhost:7051/swager , 
/// which is inside the launch-settings.json inside properties folder in the applcationUrl which is for the server from Kestrel 
/// to listen to which network ports  , so they only can contain protocol + host + port number and not the protocol + host + port + path )

/// But currently this middleware is inactive but ready as there is no authentication yet.
